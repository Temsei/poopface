      GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

Site should aim to display a retro style that is fitting with the idea of "2006 style servers" and remain clear/uncluttered.

Users should immediately have an unconscious ability to navigate through the website because of the design.

Site should load as quick as possible. //- Media/Links that cause page to lag should be used only when necessary.

Donation pages noticeable and very simple to use with minimum effort. //- PayPal + BITCOIN only - must set up a wallet for BTC!!!
